# Fluent Commit Specification

**Fluent Commit** provides a standardized approach for writing commit messages. The goal is to enhance clarity,
consistency, and collaboration across development teams by structuring commit messages in a predictable format.

---

## Structure

The Fluent Commit message is divided into three primary sections: Header, Body, and Footer. Each section plays a crucial
role in conveying the purpose and details of the commit.

```
<header>

<body>

<footer>
```

---

### Header

The Header is the first and most critical part of the commit message. It provides a quick overview of the change. The
header has the following format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

#### Type

Defines the category of the change. Use one of the predefined types to classify the commit:

<details>
<summary>Docs</summary>

### Description

Commits that involve changes to documentation files or comments. This can include README updates,
changes to code comments, or any other form of documentation relevant to the project.

### Purpose

To ensure that documentation stays accurate and up-to-date, reflecting any changes in the code or project setup.

### Common Changes

- Updating the README with new installation instructions.
- Correcting typos in documentation.
- Adding or modifying code comments.

```
docs: Update README with setup instructions for new contributors
docs(api): Fix typo in API documentation
```

**docs**

<details>
<summary>Feature</summary>

### Description

<details>
<summary>Patch</summary>

### Description

Commits that fix bugs or resolve issues in existing code. These are usually minor fixes that address
problems affecting the current functionality.

### Purpose

To address issues that need to be resolved without introducing new features or making major changes.

### Common Changes

- Fixing a bug in a function or method.
