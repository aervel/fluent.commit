# Fluent Commit Specification

**Fluent Commit** provides a standardized approach for writing commit messages. The goal is to enhance clarity,
consistency, and collaboration across development teams by structuring commit messages in a predictable format.

## Structure

The Fluent Commit message is divided into three primary sections: Header, Body, and Footer. Each section plays a crucial
role in conveying the purpose and details of the commit.

```
<header>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Header

The Header is the first and most critical part of the commit message. It provides a quick overview of the change. The
header has the following format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

#### Type

Defines the category of the change. Use one of the predefined types to classify the commit:

| Type           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ```docs```     | Commits that involve changes to documentation files or comments. This can include README updates, changes to code comments, or any other form of documentation relevant to the project.          |
| ```feature```  | Commits that introduce new features or functionality to the project. These are additions that enhance the capabilities of the software.                                                          |
| ```patch```    | Commits that fix bugs or resolve issues in existing code. These are usually minor fixes that address problems affecting the current functionality.                                               |
| ```build```    | Commits related to changes in the build or configuration process. This includes modifications to build scripts, package dependencies, or other configuration files.                              |
| ```test```     | Commits that add or modify tests in the project. This includes writing new unit tests, integration tests, or adjusting existing tests to ensure code quality and functionality.                  |
| ```refactor``` | Commits that involve code restructuring or cleanup without changing the functionality. This is focused on improving code readability, maintainability, or performance.                           |
| ```upgrade```  | Commits that involve upgrading or improving existing code for better performance or usability. This includes optimizations, enhancements, or refactoring aimed at improving the overall quality. |

## Body

The Body of the commit message provides a more detailed explanation of the change. It is separated from the Header by a
blank line.

```
